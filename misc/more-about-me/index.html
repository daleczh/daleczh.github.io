    <p>
      I indulge in billiards.
      Billiards is like breath to me.
      I'm now in the billiards team of Peking University.
      <br />
      I love snooker, of course. Yet I'm not good at that. My highest break is 65 in games and 117 in pratice. 
      My favorite snooker player is Kyren Wilson. He became a world champion in 2024!
      <br />
      I also play basketball. I used to be a super fan of Golden State Warriors in NBA, 
      but now I'm trying to forget about that team. 
      I also love Nikola Joki&#263, the Joker.
      <br />
      I used to play shuttlecock very often. But not now.

      I love guitar. I began playing guitar as I was deeply impressed by
      Tayu Lo (罗大佑) and Jonathan Lee (李宗盛). I learned to play some
      Kotaro Oshio's music when getting started.
      Nevertheless, due to the increasing work and pressure,
      I haven't played guitar for some years.
      I'm always trying to get it back.
